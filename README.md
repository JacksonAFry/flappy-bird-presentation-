# flappy-bird-presentation-

This all the files used in our Processing JS presentation, we configured code that originally belongs to Daniel Shiffman and changed it to better match our criteria. We added a custom bird, stat tweaks, different colors and a new end screen. The updated version is in the folder and has more features.
